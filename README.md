# Quick Start
To be added :)

# Debugging set up
After hours of suffering through StackOverflow and documentation, I finally got Webpack to make something that can be imported by another React project.  
Remember to use `npm link ../main-app/node_modules/react` from this directory in order to force this project to use one shared React instance and not crash when using a hook.  
_WARNING: Figuring that out along with tinkering with webpack.config.js has cost me hours_
